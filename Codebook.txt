Variables are the same in datased f and g 
But in dataset g the observations have been sumarized by activity and subject.


"subject", It is the id of the subject, goes from 1 to 30
"activity", The type of activity. 
"featuremean", the mean of the feature vector
"featureSD", the SD of the feature vector
"body_acc_x_mean", The mean of The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'
"body_acc_x_SD", The standard deviation of The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'
"body_acc_y_mean", The mean of The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer Y axis in standard gravity units 'g'
"body_acc_y_SD", The standard deviation of The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer Y axis in standard gravity units 'g'
